function l = distance_between_points(x,y)

% DISTANCE Calculate the distance.
%   DISTANCE(X,Y) calculates the distance between two
%   points X and Y. X should be a 1 x 2 (2D) or a 1 x 3 (3D)
%   vector. Y should be n x 2 matrix (for 2D), or n x 3 matrix
%   (for 3D), where n is the number of points. When n > 1,
%   distance between X and all the points in Y are returned.
%
%   (Example)
%   x = [1 1 1];
%   y = [1+sqrt(3) 2 1];
%   l = distance(x,y)


%% calculate distance %%

elseif size(x,2) == 3
   l = sqrt((x(1)-y(:,1)).^2+(x(2)-y(:,2)).^2+(x(3)-y(:,3)).^2);
